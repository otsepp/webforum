  [31m[1;31m"[0m[31mThere are many great and memorable weapons in NES games. A few notable ones would be the Spread Gun from Contra/Super C, Metal Blade from Mega Man 2, Kiai (scrolls) from TMNT 1, Jump & Slash from Ninja Gaiden 1, so on and so forth...[1;35m\n[0m[31mMost weapons acquired in NES games serve at least some purpose in helping you succeed. But there are ones that don't. Here are a few off the top of my head that are (in my opinion) useless:[1;35m\n[0m[31mThorn Whip [Castlevania II] - The first available whip upgrade in the game, it really isn't worth spending the hearts to get it. I feel that you're better off saving your hearts and sticking with the starting leather whip until you get the chain whip.[1;35m\n[0m[31mDiamond [also CV II] - Weapon really has no use. I usually grab it just to feel like I 100% beat the game, but I never use it. Plus, you have to go out of the way to get it (and deal with those vertically moving stone platforms).[1;35m\n[0m[31mMachine Gun [Bionic Commando] - The last gun you acquire in the game. By the time you obtain it there are only 3 levels left to beat, and the Rocket Launder is optimum for all 3.[1;35m\n[0m[31mFire [The Krion Conquest] - It drains your health bar to use, and doesn't really help you in any part of the game. I never use it.[1;35m\n[0m[31mRocket Launcher [G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor] - Another weapon you obtain late in the game. There isn't much time to level it up, it uses a lot of ammo, and the Laser Rifle is much more potent against the bosses.[1;35m\n[0m[31mWhat are some weapons that you find to be useless? Let's hear em![1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
